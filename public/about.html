        <h1>About me and my interests</h1>
        <p>I am passionate about art and always want to find a way to make someting look pretty. I am also very passionate about web design and web development since everything is going online now and the concept of using words in order to create something visually appealing has always fascinated me.<br/>\
        In my free time I like to do some 3D printing and I am interested in learning how to create 3D designs to be able to print them afterwards.<br/>
        Photography is also a passion that I have, it gives me the opportunity to capture the beautiful things in life and then create a visual story with my photos.
        </p>

        <p>To sound clich√©, I am a hard worker and always dedicated to my job and my interests, but in reality, I am willing to give veryting that I do my full and undivided attention and I am proud of my work and creations, whether it is designing a small sticker and printing it, branding a full vehicle, applicating a digitally printed sticker to a chromadeck sheet or even creating my resume on a website, it is my work that I am proud of.</p>
